def open(file, mode='r', buffering=-1, encoding=None, errors=None,
         newline=None):
    r"""Open the file and create a corresponding `file object`_.

    If the file cannot be opened, an OSError is raised. This behaves analog to
    pythons builtin :py:func:`open` function. See `Reading and Writing Files`_
    for examples of io using python.

    :param str mode:
        Mode in which the file is opened. Defaults to 'r' which means
        open for reading in text mode. Other common values are 'w' for
        writing (truncating the file if it already exists), 'x' for
        exclusive creation of a new file, and 'a' for appending. The
        available modes are:

        ========= ===================================================
        Character Meaning
        --------- ---------------------------------------------------
        'r'       open for reading (default)
        'w'       open for writing, truncating the file first
        'x'       create a new file and open it for writing
        'a'       open for writing, appending to the end of the file
        'b'       binary mode
        't'       text mode (default)
        '+'       open a disk file for updating (reading and writing)
        ========= ===================================================

        The default value is 'r' (open for reading text, a synonym of 'rt').
        For binary random access, the mode 'w+b' opens and truncates the
        file to 0 bytes, while 'r+b' opens the file without truncation. The
        'x' mode implies 'w' and raises an `FileExistsError` if the file
        already exists.

        Python distinguishes between files opened in binary and text mode.
        Files opened in binary mode (appending 'b' to the mode argument)
        return contents as bytes objects without any decoding. In text mode
        (the default, or when 't' is appended to the mode argument), the
        contents of the file are returned as strings, the bytes having
        first been decoded using *encoding*.
    :param int buffering:
        Buffering policy. Pass 0 to switch buffering off (only allowed in
        binary mode), 1 to select line buffering (only usable in text mode),
        and an integer > 1 to indicate the size of a fixed-size chunk
        buffer. When no buffering argument is given.

        Files are buffered in fixed-size chunks; the size of the buffer is
        chosen using a heuristic trying to determine the underlying device's
        blksize and falling back on `io.DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE`. The buffer
        will typically be 4096 or 8192 bytes long.
    :param str encoding:
        Encoding used to decode or encode the file. Can only be used in text
        mode. The default encoding is platform dependent, but any encoding
        supported by Python can be passed. See the codecs module for the
        list of supported encodings.
    :param str errors:
        How encoding errors are to be handled. Can not be used in binary
        mode. Pass 'strict' to raise a ValueError exception if there is an
        encoding error (the default of None has the same effect), or pass
        'ignore' to ignore errors. (Note that ignoring encoding errors can
        lead to data loss.) See the documentation for codecs.register for a
        list of the permitted encoding error strings.
    :param str newline:
        How universal newlines work (only applies to text mode). Can be
        None, '', '\n', '\r', and '\r\n'. Works as follows:

        * On input, if newline is None, universal newlines mode is enabled.
          Lines in the input can end in '\n', '\r', or '\r\n', and these are
          translated into '\n' before being returned to the caller. If it is
          '', universal newline mode is enabled, but line endings are
          returned to the caller untranslated. If it has any of the other
          legal values, input lines are only terminated by the given string,
          and the line ending is returned to the caller untranslated.

        * On output, if newline is None, any '\n' characters written are
          translated to the system default line separator, os.linesep. If
          newline is '', no translation takes place. If newline is any of
          the other legal values, any '\n' characters written are translated
          to the given string.
    :rtype: file-like
    :returns:
        A new `file object`_. When used to open a file in a text mode ('w',
        'r', 'wt', 'rt', etc.), the object will be a TextIOWrapper. When
        used to open a file in a binary mode, the returned class varies:
        in read binary mode, it will be a BufferedReader; in write binary
        and append binary modes, it will be a BufferedWriter, and in
        read/write mode, it will be a BufferedRandom. If buffering is
        disabled, the object will be a `FileLikeIO`.
    :raises TypeError:
        Invalid argument passed.
    :raises ValueError:
        Invalid argument passed.
    :raises OSError:
        Failed to open file.
